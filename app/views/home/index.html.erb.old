<h1>Welcome to qRPSd on Rails</h1>
The app is in production mode so this won't show up till restart
qRPSd on Rails is a collection of "general-purpose" GM/DM tools. <br />
We aim to be "game-agnostic" - however we focus our development efforts towards supporting 3 major systems:

<ul>
	<li>qRPS (soggyRPS) - a "generic role playing system that relies on player-driven trait definitions"</li>
	<li>D&amp;D (our toolset is meant to aid in playing 3.0/3.5e, and some tools will aid in 4.0 campaigns as well)</li>
	<li>GURPS</li>
</ul>
GURPS and D&amp;D are trademark/copyright their respective owners. None of our tools infringe upon their content nor violate their gaming licenses.<br />
