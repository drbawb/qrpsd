Introduction:
(If you're looking to implement this, you should read "Shortcomings:" before even attempting to install this software)

qRPSd has been created for the sole purpose of playing classic tabletop RPGs online.
This is "version 1" and provides the following key aspects:
1) An interactive "battle field" / "game mat" (coloiqually referred to as "the grid.")
2) A dice roller that allows for basic statistics tracking through the in-game interface.
3) Ability to create and manage RPG entities (characters, campaigns, grids, tokens)
4) Permissions to help separate DM (daemon-master) accessible information from player accessible information.
5) Integration with a chat environment (see "IRC:" / "DRB:")
6) Ability to store uploaded files (mainly: character sheets in the form of an excel spreadsheet.)

As of this release, I believe it meets the requirements initially laid out for our "version 1" release.
(Version 1 is in quotes because this is still very much alpha software. No work has been made to simplify
the installation/distribution of qRPSd at this point in time.)

Planned features:
qRPSd will eventually evolve into an engine, of sorts.
I hope to create a parser that will take in a ruleset file, and create a playable game, in the form of a rails application.
In essence, if you convert a tabletop RPG's basic rules into this ruleset language, you can play it on qRPSd.
This is referred to as "version 2" of qRPSd.

There will be a separate fork of this project devoted to work on the engine.

IRC:
I host my own IRC server along with an IRC chatbot.
This game directly interfaces with that chatbot using distributed ruby.
This is in no way required to play the game, and as such I will be extracting the functionality out to a configuration file.

If you'd like to interface with the game in a similar way, I plan to provide an API defining
the actions you can respond to.

All you'll need is a listener capable of implementing the DRb protocol.

Shortcomings:
These are known shortcomings of this release. As I said earlier, no effort has been made
towards the installation/distribution of this software.

1) No installation script:
You will have to create your own database.yml
You will have to set up Devise to use your own mailer / mailing address.
-Reason: I host this in two locations, so my .gitignore excludes database.yml

2) You will have to dump the current schema.rb into a database
-Reason: No installation script

3) You will have to manually set the "role" on users:
-If you set role to "admin", they can pretty much have free-reign of the application
-If you set role to "user", they can have free-reign over anything they've created.
-Reason: Not enough time, this'll be added very shortly.

4) Some things are just not accessible through the interface, you /have/ to know their resource URL:
-Reason: Not enough time, I'll be revamping the UI to make it dead-simple very shortly.
-Things I know need to be accessed via URL:
- /grids/new
- /grids/:grid_id/show (only :grid_id 1 is shown on the homepage, and this relies on its existence / your ability to view it)
- /grids/:grid_id/tokens (DM token management interface. Hidden because the permissions aren't complete yet.)

5) No DB Seed, you will have to "sign up" for the first account, and as mentioned above, manually mark it as "role: admin" via editing the DB.
